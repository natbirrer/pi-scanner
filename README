This is a python tool for running OP25 trunked radio scanner on a headless
Raspberry Pi with a small touchscreen and RTL SDR dongle.

TODO:

Create dir for each trunking configuration
    - include trunk.tsv, location.tsv, location.wlist
    - include custom bash script to run op25

Create some test configurations
 - partially done

Clean up GUI

Add volume controls
 - added hard button volume control but volume steps are in log scale, 
   which is not ideal... low priority fix

Change button functions to augment GUI
 - currently poweroff, screen backlight on/off, volume up/down, run main scan
 - more functionality can be crammed into buttons, prioritize

Pipe talkgroup ID from OP25 to GUI
 - this could be difficult, consider creating new version of rx.py
   instead of calling it from another script
